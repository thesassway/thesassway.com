# Contributing

The Sass Way would not be possible without the generous submissions of so many
amazing folks from the Sass community. We welcome contributions from our
readers! You can submit articles or news items using the process outlined
below. Bug fixes and edits are also encouraged.

## Articles

To submit an article for publication on TheSassWay.com, here's the suggested
process:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add a new article to the `source` directory of your fork.
3. Commit your changes
4. Submit a pull request

We recommend that you also message @TheSassWay on Twitter before starting to
make sure that the topic you have chosen will be appropriate for our readers.

## News

If you have news about Sass or Compass, tweet at us on Twitter (mention
@TheSassWay) or create a new issue in our repository.

If you choose to submit an issue, title the issue appropriately and include an
140-character description so that it is easy to tweet.

Right now we don't post news about Sass or Compass on the website, instead we
tweet about it as we've found that it's much easier for us to maintain.

Appropriate news items are:

* A new library for Sass or Compass that would be of general interest to the
  community
* A tutorial or story about Sass from your own blog
* A cool Sass demo that you've built
* Announcements about new Sass books, conferences, tools, etc...

We won't tweet every news item that is submitted. We try not to overwhelm our
subscribers with too many tweets. We are also looking for high quality
submissions.
