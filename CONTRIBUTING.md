# Contributing

The Sass Way is a community powered website. We rely on our readers to send us
the latest news about Sass and Compass and look for contributions from the
community to maintain the site and create new articles.

## News

If you have news about Sass or Compass, please create a new issue on our
repository. Title the issue appropriately and include an 140-character
description so that it is easy to tweet.

Right now we don't post news about Sass or Compass on the website, instead we
tweet about it as we've found that it's much easier for us to maintain.

Appropriate news items are:

* A new library for Sass or Compass that would be of general interest to the
  community
* A tutorial or story about Sass from your own blog
* A cool Sass demo that you've built
* Announcements about new Sass books, conferences, tools, etc...

We won't tweet every news item that is submitted. We try not to overwhelm our
subscribers with too many tweets. We are also looking for high quality
submissions.

## Articles

The Sass Way would not be possible without the generous submissions of so many
amazing folks from the Sass community. If you'd like to submit an article for
publication on TheSassWay.com, here's the suggested process:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add a new article to the `source` directory of your fork.
3. Commit your changes
4. Submit a pull request

We recommend that you also message @TheSassWay on Twitter before starting to make
sure that the topic you have chosen will be appropriate for our readers.
