h1. Using Textile

Textile provides a simple way of converting plain text to HTML. While
similar to Markdown, the syntax is slightly closer to HTML, and allows
you a bit more control over the HTML output. Inline HTML is supported.

To create a page with Textile, make a new file with a
<code>.textile</code> extension inside the <code>content/pages</code>
folder. See the <a
href="https://github.com/gma/nesta-demo-content/raw/master/pages/examples/using-textile.textile">source</a> of this page for an example.

The "Textile project page":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ gives more details on Textile's syntax.
