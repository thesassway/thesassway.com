## Foundation is awesome.

I come out of the gate saying, "Foundation is awesome." It's the perfect flexible grid from desktop to mobile.

Foundation includes forms, buttons, and a UI library. Plus other [ZURB Playground](http://www.zurb.com/playground) favorites like [Orbit](http://www.zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider) and [Reveal](http://www.zurb.com/playground/reveal-modal-plugin).

With [case studies](http://foundation.zurb.com/case-foundation.php) like [ZURB Jobs](http://www.zurb.com/jobs), [Swizzle](http://foundation.zurb.com/case-swizzle.php) and [the Foundation site itself](http://foundation.zurb.com/case-foundation.php), how can we deny ZURB of hitting this one out of the park?

## Foundation's Features

ZURB Foundation features a set of global styles that include Eric Meyer's reset, tested styles for typography, links, lists, tables and more.

* [The Grid](http://foundation.zurb.com/grid.php), built for [rapid prototyping](http://foundation.zurb.com/prototyping.php) and [mobility](http://foundation.zurb.com/mobile.php)
* Various [layout](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/layout.php) options
* [UI Elements](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/ui.php)
* [Buttons](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/buttons.php) and [forms](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/forms.php)
* Plus [playground](http://www.zurb.com/playground) favorites [Orbit](http://www.zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider) and [Reveal](http://www.zurb.com/playground/reveal-modal-plugin)

And ZURB didn't stop there, they did an awesome job showing off [the documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/index.php) too. You can learn about all the features of Foundation, as well as how to use it on mobile and desktop displays.

## Installation

From your Terminal ...
    
    :::bash
    (sudo) gem install ZURB-foundation
    
If you use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/), simply add `ZURB-foundation` to your `Gemfile` and `bundle install`.

    :::bash
    gem 'ZURB-foundation'
    
Form here, you have a few options on getting started with ZURB Foundation. You can start a Compass-based project with ZURB Foundation or you can install ZURB Foundation into an existing Compass-based project.

### Start a Compass-based project with ZURB Foundation

You can start a brand new project using Compass and ZURB Foundation with the following `compass` command.

    :::bash
    compass create <project-name> -r ZURB-foundation --using ZURB-foundation --force

If you'd like to require ZURB Foundation to install using a particular Sass syntax, use the Compass `--syntax` flag. Here's an example.

    :::bash
    compass create <my_project> -r ZURB-foundation --using ZURB-foundation --syntax sass --force

### Install ZURB Foundation into an existing Compass-based project

You can install ZURB Foundation into an existing project with Compass in place already.

    :::bash
    compass install ZURB-foundation/project

Running this will unfurl a number of files from the ZURB Foundation gem using the Compass framework.

    :::bash
    -> % compass install ZURB-foundation/project
    directory images/misc/ 
    directory images/orbit/
