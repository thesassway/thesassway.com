# Forge, a WordPress theme development toolkit with Sass and CoffeeScript

Forge is a open source command-line toolkit for developing WordPress themes using pre-processing languages like Sass and Compass for your CSS and CoffeeScript for your JavaScript.

## Build WordPress themes using Sass and CoffeeScript

It's been possible all along to use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) in your WordPress themes, but now Forge makes it even easier and adds support for [CoffeeScript](https://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) as well. Forge is brought to you by the fine folks at [The Theme Foundry](http://thethemefoundry.com/), the same people behind the awesome responsive WordPress theme [React](http://thethemefoundry.com/react/).

If you're a WordPress fan and have been looking for a way to work with Sass and CoffeeScript in your themes, Forge is your answer!
