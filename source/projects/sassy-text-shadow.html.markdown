# Sassy Text Shadows

How far is too far when it comes to CSS text shadows? Be prepared to cross that line and then some with [Mason Wendell](/mason-wendell) in his project [Sassy Text Shadows](http://sassymothereffingtextshadow.com/).

## What is Sassy Text Shadows?

Sassy Text Shadows is a response to the call put forth by Paul Irish's [Mother Effing Text Shadow](http://mothereffingtextshadow.com/). It's also an answer to the burning question, "Why would you want to use trigonometry in CSS?"

## Shadows in a Circle

Mason is the first to admit that the practical uses of this technique are probably limited. Most of the time when CSS shadows are piled more than a few levels deep it's likely so that we can explore and test what's possible. That's no different here, and Mason has some fun playing with that concept.

On his [Sassy Mother Effing Text Shadows](http://sassymothereffingtextshadow.com/) site, he shows how you can use Sass to generate a string of text shadow variables that can be manipulated in many ways to create waves and shapes.

The basic concept is fairly simple:

* Loop thru a series iterations on a variable
* Create a new text-shadow string on each iteration
* Then add those together as the final, long, text shadow

### Sassy Text Shadows gem

The [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/sassy-text-shadow) allows you to do this yourself, and adds trigonometry into the mix. Out of the box you get a pretty nice circular text shadow (as shown above). You can also pass various arguments to the function for some very interesting results.

See [the readme](https://github.com/canarymason/sassytextshadow#readme) for install details

    :::scss
    // Basic Red Circle
    h1 { 
      @include text-shadow(sassy-text-shadow(#b80000)); 
    }
    
    // Ranbow Wave
    h1 {
      @include text-shadow(sassy-text-shadow(#b80000, 100, 80, 120, 90, -45, 0.09));
    }
    
The arguments are (in order):

* `$color` -- the starting color of the shadow $iterations: how many shadows to generate  
* `$rad` -- the radius of the curve   
* `$deg` -- how far around the curve to go  
* `$cos-i` -- the multiplier for cos()   
* `$sin-i` -- the multiplier for sin() 
* `$color-multiplier` -- an amount to shift the hue of the color as it iterates


## A Lorenz Attractor Text Shadow

<a href="http://sassymothereffingtextshadow.com/"><img src="/attachments/sassy-text-shadow-lorenz.png" class="full" /></a>

Mason also wrote a [Lorenz Attractor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_Attractor) in Sass. Just for fun, and to see how long and impractical this really is, [view the final CSS code of lmao.css](http://sassymothereffingtextshadow.com/stylesheets/lmao.css). It's quite possible that generating 5000 text shadows is a bit off the deep end, but the results are pretty interesting.

### Sassy Lorenz Attractor

    :::scss
    // Sassy Lorenz Attractor
    @function lmao($orig-color, $iterations, $sx, $sy, $sz) {
      $output: '';
      $end: $iterations;

      $x0: $sx / 10;
      $y0: $sy;
      $z0: $sz;
      $h: 0.01;
      $a: 10.0;
      $b: 28.0;
      $c: 8.0 / 3.0;

      @for $i from 0 through $end {
        $x1: $x0 + $h * $a * ($y0 - $x0);
        $y1: $y0 + $h * ($x0 * ($b - $z0) - $y0);
        $z1: $z0 + $h * ($x0 * $y0 - $c * $z0);

        $xval: $x1 * -50;
        $yval: $y1 * -20;
        $spread: $z1 * .1;

        $color: rgba($orig-color, ($i / $end));
        $color: adjust-hue($color, $z1);

        $output: $output + '#{$color} #{$xval}px #{$yval}px #{$spread}px';
         @if $i < $end {
           $output: $output + ', ';
         }

         $x0: $x1;
         $y0: $y1;
         $z0: $z1;

      }

      @return unquote($output);
    }

    h1 {
      @include text-shadow(lmao(#b80000, 5000, 6, 4, 6));
    }
