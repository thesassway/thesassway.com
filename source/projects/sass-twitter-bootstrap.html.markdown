# Sass Twitter Bootstrap

Twitter's "Bootstrap" is a HOT topic, especially in the Sass community. Sadly, they used LESS instead of Sass. Well, fellow staff member John W. Long changed that with [Sass Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap).

Thanks [John](http://wiseheartdesign.com/) for stepping out and porting this for all of us Sass-lovers to enjoy!
