# Stitch: A CSS pattern framework

## Common CSS patterns as mixins and classes

Stitch is a nice companion to Compass that gives you access to CSS design patterns you likely use every day. It claims to be more than just chunks of code, and aims to create patterns in your workflow and change the way you write CSS.

Stitch labels itself as "for compass", though I do see a bit of overlap in mixins like [clear-floats](https://github.com/anthonyshort/stitch-css/blob/master/stylesheets/stitch/patterns/layout/_clear-floats.scss), and [image-replace](https://github.com/anthonyshort/stitch-css/blob/master/stylesheets/stitch/patterns/images/_image-replace.scss) and its own [CSS reset](https://github.com/anthonyshort/stitch-css/blob/master/stylesheets/stitch/_reset.scss) -- but overall has some good potential.

[Fork it](https://github.com/anthonyshort/stitch-css) and [submit some issues](https://github.com/anthonyshort/stitch-css/issues). Help this thing move along.
