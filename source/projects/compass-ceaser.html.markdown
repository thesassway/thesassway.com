## CSS3 transitions and animations made easy

If you're a fan of the hawtness of CSS3 animations and transitions, you are going to love [Jared Hardy's](http://twitter.com/#!/jaredhardy) Compass Ceaser Easing. Jared is also known for his [Sassy Buttons project](/projects/sassy-buttons).

Compass Ceaser Easing is a Compass extension based on the [ceasar css easing animation tool](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/) by [@matthewlein](http://twitter.com/#!/matthewlein) and provides transitions based on the classic [Penner equations](http://robertpenner.com/easing/) by [Robert Penner](http://robertpenner.com/).

The Ceaser easing extension provides a sass function and a mixin called ceaser to make creating animations super easy!

### Ceaser easing function

    :::scss
    // Transition
    #transition {
      transition: all 1.2s ceaser("ease-in");
    }

    // Animation
    #animation-shorthand {
      animation: animateMe 10s ceaser("easeInSine") infinite;
    }

### Ceaser easing mixin

    :::scss
    // Create a 500 millisecond transition on only the width w/ a delay of 1 second
    @include ceaser(easeInOutExpo, width, 500ms, 1s);
    
    #box {
      width: 500px;
      @include ceaser(easeInOutExpo, width, 500ms, 1s);
    }

    #box:hover {
      width: 700px;
    }
