# Here's your chance to become a contributor to The Sass Way!

<a href="http://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com"><img src="/images/articles/octocat.png" class="ml1 mb1" alt="" align="right"></a>

It's no secret that things have been a little quiet around here lately. Part of that is that is that we've been working on some much needed infrastructure updates. We recently moved the site over from [Nesta](http://nestacms.com) to [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and just rolled out a new design for the site that is consistent with the updated brand for Sass and looks great on mobile.

Today, I'd like to announce that we've put the [source code](http://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com) for TheSassWay.com on GitHub and we'd like to invite you to contribute! You heard me correctly! If you've been looking for a way to give back to the Sass community we'd love to have your help around here.

Our vision for The Sass Way is to be the premiere source of articles, tutorials, and news about Sass. We want to make it easy for folks to get up and running with the language we have come to know and love. Sass has changed our lives for the better and we want to tell the world about it.

But we can't do this without you! We need your help! Starting today we are accepting new article and news submissions from anyone in the Sass community via GitHub.


## How to contribute

1. Fork the project on Github: [http://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com](http://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com)
2. Write your article in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
3. Send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

Oh, and be sure you've read our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!


## GitHub issue tracker

We've also setup an issue tracker on our GitHub project. If you come across something on the site that needs to be fixed, [file an issue there](https://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com/issues). Want to fix it yourself? Send us a pull request.

We'll also be using the issue tracker for Twitter submissions. You heard that right. If you'd like to suggest that we Tweet about an article that you've written on your own site or a bit of Sass news, file an issue with the suggested tweet text. If we like it, we'll tweet about it from our [@TheSassWay](http://twitter.com/thesassway) Twitter handle.


## Let's kick some Sass!

The Sass Way wouldn't be what it is today without the input of so many people from the Sass community. Hopefully our new open publishing model will make it even easier for folks to contribute. Let us know what you think.

So what are you waiting for? Let's make The Sass Way awesome!
