# Are you on #teamSass?

Join the movement! Tell the world you are on #teamSass ...

## It started with a Tweet!

[Jeff Croft](http://jeffcroft.com/) is known to be in the trenches of standards-aware web design and development. He's also known for [speaking at conferences](http://jeffcroft.com/speaking/) and thinking in terms of ["frameworks for designers"](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/frameworksfordesigners) and authoring books like ["Pro CSS Techniques"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159059732X). So, when he says he's on [#teamSass](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23teamSass), it's a big deal.

For some reason, on a Friday afternoon - August 19th, 2011 ... Jeff decided to [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/jcroft/status/104640770878877696) the message in the screenshot below and tell the world he was on [#teamSass](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23teamSass).

Moments later, [Nathan Smith](http://sonspring.com/) joined in on the fun.

And then [Jina Bolton](http://about.me/jina) [confesses](https://twitter.com/#!/jina/status/104641295779237888) that she's to blame. If you're going to be at [Madison Ruby Conference](http://madisonruby.org/), you will also get to enjoy Jina's [#teamSass slide](https://twitter.com/#!/jina/status/104644063445270529) ([slide image](http://twitpic.com/68kjzb)) first hand in her talk ["CSS Workflow with Sass"](http://madisonruby.org/speakers#jina_bolton).

## So, what is #teamSass?

To be honest, we're not 100% sure. Even the likes of [David Kaneda](http://9-bits.com/), Creative director at [Sencha](http://www.sencha.com/), isn't sure, but he wants in. Side note: Sencha is a HUGE advocate and user of [Sass and Compass](http://www.sencha.com/blog/search/3c2d65615710259a0f341e13fa841ac4/).

### A hashtag in time

At its most basic level, #teamSass is a Twitter hashtag.

It's also a moment in time. For a span of a few hours on a Friday afternoon, Sass lovers united on Twitter to exchange a few tweets to share their passion for Sass and encourage others about one of their most favorite and beloved tools for authoring CSS. **Good times.**

## How can you join?
