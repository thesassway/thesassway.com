# "Sass for Designers", by Nathan Smith

I love how Nathan opens with, "I aim for this to be the article I wish I had read when I was first contemplating Sass but (at the time) did not consider it worthwhile. I could not have been more wrong."

Nathan, I'm with you. I too want to know, "who in their right mind wants to type all that?" I just don't get it. It's like working for your money vs making your money work for you.

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) has certainly proved itself as the standard library for Sass that's for sure. I just don't get why some refuse to use it, or think that it's overkill. I use it for [the CSS3 Mixins](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/) alone! Not to mention [Vertical Rhythm](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/), as you mentioned, and those useful [Utilities Mixins](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/utilities/).
