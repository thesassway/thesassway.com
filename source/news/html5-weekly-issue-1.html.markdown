# HTML5 Weekly links to check out!

We get linked to not once, but twice (technically) from the inaugural issue of [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/) from [Peter Cooper](http://peterc.org/).

Peter linked to us us as, "The Ruby Inside of Sass." Thanks Peter. He also linked to a recent episode of The Changelog (our sister blog and podcast), [Episode 0.6.7 w/ Paul Irish](http://thechangelog.com/post/9123518427/episode-0-6-7-html5-boilerplate-modernizr-and-more-with) on HTML5, CSS3, Polyfills and more. We've gotten so much good feedback on this episode, so we rate it as a must listen. Plus, Paul shares the name of his coding hero ([Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net/) of [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/)) as well as his thoughts on Sass and Compass.
