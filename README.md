# The Sass Way

This is the main repository for The Sass Way! ~Your source for the latest tips,
tricks, and news about Sass and Compass.~

We had a good run, but after years of inactivity we are retiring the site.
Authors are welcome to republish the content on their own sites.

For the moment, articles can be viewed here: http://thesassway.herokuapp.com/


## Getting started

TheSassWay is powered by [Middleman][2]. Middleman is a Ruby-powered static
site generator that allows us to store the source for the entire website here
in GitHub.

To run the site on your local machine, you'll need to have [Ruby][3] setup with
[Bundler][4]. New to the command prompt? [Start here.][5]

First, install the necessary Gems:

    bundle install

Then start the preview server:

    rake server

This will startup a Middleman preview server on:

    http://localhost:5000

That's really it! Edit files in the source directory and refresh your browser
to see your changes.
