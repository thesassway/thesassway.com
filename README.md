# The Sass Way

This is the main repository for The Sass Way! Your source for the latest tips, tricks, and news about Sass and Compass.

Interested in helping out here? [Read our CONTRIBUTING file first.](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting started

TheSassWay is powered by [Middleman][1]. Middleman is a Ruby-powered static site generator that allows us to store the source for the entire website here in GitHub.

To run the site on your local machine, you'll need to have [Ruby][2] setup with [Bundler][3].

First, install the necessary Gems:

    bundle install

Then start the preview server:

    rake server

This will startup a Middleman preview server on:

    http://localhost:5000

That's really it! Edit files in the source directory and refresh your browser to see your changes.
